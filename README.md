# landing-page-practice
Introduction:
This is going to be my first "real" webpage. I've done
plenty of practice before, but this is going to be quite the
challange. I'm struggling a bit with getting flexbox to work
exactly as intended, but I think if I draw a map displaying 
a flexbox layout then I should be able to make enough logic out of it.

Speaking of, I do have to follow a layout given to me; however,
it's totally up to me as to what I decide to put into it. The
layout kind of reminds me of an attorney website so I might go
with that.


Things I'll be practicing that's new since my prev. project:
a) Cascading Style Sheets
b) Everything Flexbox
c) Basic CSS properties
d) Inspecting elements (Chrome) to deduce malfunctions
